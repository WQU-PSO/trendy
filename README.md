Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)

Run main.py file to find optimum parameters
Run optimum_backtest.py which has optimum parameters manually entered for plotting

Details of the strategy shown in Strategy_breakdown.pdf. I walk you through
chunks of code explaining what is happening

Had to change one line of code in pyfolio library as I was short on time.

I've added the whole library into this folder as it'll be much easier to Run
(will fix for final project)
